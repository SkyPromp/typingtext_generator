# Typingtest Generators
This project will be able to generate multiple typing tests depending on the parameters.

## Words format
The words in the file, e.g. words.txt should be separated by newlines
## Compile
gcc -o run.exe filename
## words_numbers.c
run.exe -> this will generate the data using the words in words.txt
run.exe filename -> this will generate the data using the words in the filename
